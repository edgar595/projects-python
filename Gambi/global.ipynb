    "* Eco Levy: Introduced on imported environmentally harmful products like sanitary towels, diapers, motorcycles, tires, plastic packaging, and electronic equipment.\n",
    "* 16% VAT: Applied to ordinary bread, sugarcane transportation, locally assembled mobile phones, electric bikes, solar and lithium-ion batteries, and electric buses, changing their tax status from exempt to standard.\n",
    "* Excise Duty Calculation: Adjusted for alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and tobacco products, potentially increasing taxes on these items by up to 40% or higher for stronger alcoholic drinks.\n",
    "* 25% Excise Duty: Imposed on vegetable and seed oils; 5% duty or KES 27,000 per ton on coal, whichever is higher.\n",
    "* Road Maintenance Levy: Increased from KES 18 to KES 25 per liter of fuel, raising fuel prices.\n",
    "* 20% Excise Duty: Applied to financial services transactions, telephone and internet services, lottery, betting, gaming, and internet/social media advertisements.\n",
    "* Motor Vehicle Tax: Introduced a 2.5% tax with a minimum of KES 5,000, later amended to remove the maximum limit of KES 100,000.\"\"\"\n",
