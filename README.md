# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python projects repository! This repository contains various data analysis and machine learning projects implemented in Python. Below is an overview of each project:

## 1. LoanAmount Prediction

- **Objective**: Predict the loan amount using over 30 features.
- **Description**: This project involves predicting the loan amount based on a dataset with over 30 features. It includes data preprocessing (imputing missing values, fixing outliers), exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and model selection. The project settled on using Random Forest and fine-tuned it for optimal accuracy. The results are showcased using Streamlit.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Streamlit
- **Folder**: `loanamount-prediction`

## 2. Firebase Authentication and Health EDA

- **Objective**: Implement Firebase authentication and visualize exploratory health data analysis.
- **Description**: This project integrates Firebase for authentication features and includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of health-related data. It showcases interactive features for exploring health trends.
- **Technologies**: Python, Firebase, Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Folder**: `firebase-auth-health-eda`

## 3. Malaria Image Classification

- **Objective**: Classify malaria images as infected or uninfected using TensorFlow.
- **Description**: This project utilizes TensorFlow to classify malaria images into infected or uninfected categories. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. A Streamlit dashboard is used to showcase the image classification model.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit, OpenCV
- **Folder**: `malaria-image-classification`

## 4. Person of Interest Image Classification

- **Objective**: Identify persons of interest using image classification techniques.
- **Description**: This project employs OpenCV for detecting eyes and frontal faces, and wavelet transforms for image classification to identify persons of interest among five different actors. It involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
- **Technologies**: Python, OpenCV, Wavelet Transform, Image Classification
- **Folder**: `person-of-interest-classification`

## 5. Question Answering with ViLT and Streamlit

- **Objective**: Answer questions from images using Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT) and showcase results in Streamlit.
- **Description**: This project utilizes ViLT for question answering from images. It includes model integration, question processing, and displaying results interactively using Streamlit.
- **Technologies**: Python, ViLT, Streamlit, Transformers
- **Folder**: `qa-vilt-streamlit`

## 6. Tweet Sentiment Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze tweet sentiments to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Description**: This project involves analyzing tweet data to classify sentiments using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes data collection, preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.), feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using BERT analysis and also Vader. The project results are displayed using a dash app.
- **Technologies**: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, BERT, dash
- **Folder**: tweet-sentiment-analysis

## 7. Kenyan Law PDF Analysis

- **Objective**: Extract and analyze text from the Constitution of Kenya PDF.
- **Description**: This project involves extracting text from the Constitution of Kenya PDF, identifying chapters and their titles, retrieving chapter content, summarizing text, and searching for specific legal provisions. It uses PyPDF2 for text extraction, regular expressions for pattern matching, and transformers for summarization. The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the constitutional text.
- **Technologies**: Python, PyPDF2, Regular Expressions, Natsort, Transformers
- **Folder**: `kenyan-law-analysis`
